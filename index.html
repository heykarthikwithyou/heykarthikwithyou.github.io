The Custody actor was married to the Kushi star for almost four years before they announced their separation in 2021. While Chaitanya and Samantha have been tight-lipped about the reason behind their split, the actor confirmed that the divorce came through last year and they’ve been legally single for a year now. Speaking with the Times of India, Naga Chaitanya said that he and Samantha have moved on in their lives. Praising Samantha, Chaitanya said, “She is a lovely person and deserves all happiness. It is only when the media speculates that things get awkward between us. In the public eye, that mutual respect is taken away. That’s what I feel bad about. And you do what is worse? They bring in a third party, someone who is not connected to my part to create headlines out of that. It’s very disrespectful to the third party whom they are unnecessarily involving with my past.</h5>

                </h2>
                <h5 class="font-weight-normal m-0">Uric acid, a crucial waste product, forms part of the most important anti-oxidants found in the biological fluids of humans. According to doctors, in normal circumstances, the uric acid levels should range between 3.5 to 7.2 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL). Uric acid is created when the human body breaks down purines which is a type of chemical. Health experts maintain that most uric acid dissolves in the blood, passes through the kidneys and leaves the body in urine. However, certain food and drinks like Seafood, red meat, organ meats like liver, alcohol (especially beer, including non-alcohol beer) etc., can lead to increased levels of uric acid in the body.</h5>

An internal order issued by Akashvani Director General Vasudha Gupta on Wednesday seeks compliance with immediate effect to the statutory provision which had replaced the name of AIR (All India Radio) to Akashvani. This is a very old decision of the government which was not operationalised earlier. We are now operationalising it, Gaurav Dwivedi, Chief Executive Officer, Prasar Bharati said.</p>

                  <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">President Joe Biden emphasized the importance of safety in artificial intelligence products during a meeting with CEOs of major AI companies such as Microsoft and Google on Thursday. The two-hour meeting began at 11:45 am ET (1545 GMT) and included Google's Sundar Pichai, Microsoft Corp's Satya Nadella, OpenAI's Sam Altman and Anthropic's Dario Amodei, along with Vice President Kamala Harris and administration officials including Biden's Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Director of the National Economic Council Lael Brainard and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. The growing popularity of generative AI, exemplified by ChatGPT and similar apps, has spurred companies to launch their own versions that they believe will revolutionize various industries. However, with millions of users already utilizing these tools for tasks such as medical diagnoses, writing screenplays, and debugging software, concerns have arisen over privacy violations, biased employment decisions, and the potential for scams and misinformation campaigns. President Biden, who has used ChatGPT himself, urged the officials to prioritize mitigating the current and potential risks AI poses to individuals, society, and national security. The White House highlighted the importance of AI companies ensuring the safety of their products before deployment.</p>

                  <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Jeff Bezos beat large retailers by adopting the internet in the early 1990s through a combination of innovative thinking, strategic planning, and execution. At the time, most retailers were operating through brick-and-mortar stores, with very little online presence. However, Bezos saw the potential of the internet as a new sales channel, and he realised that by leveraging its reach, he could offer a much wider selection of products to customers than traditional retailers could.</p>

        <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal line-4">Telugu actor Naga Chaitanya opened up about his divorce from Samantha Ruth Prabhu and the impact of his dating rumours on his equation with ex-wife Samantha Ruth Prabhu. The Custody actor was married to the Kushi star for almost four years before they announced their separation in 2021. While Chaitanya and Samantha have been tight-lipped about the reason behind their split, the actor confirmed that the divorce came through last year and they’ve been legally single for a year now. Speaking with the Times of India, Naga Chaitanya said that he and Samantha have moved on in their lives. Praising Samantha, Chaitanya said, “She is a lovely person and deserves all happiness. It is only when the media speculates that things get awkward between us. In the public eye, that mutual respect is taken away. That’s what I feel bad about. And you do what is worse? They bring in a third party, someone who is not connected to my part to create headlines out of that. It’s very disrespectful to the third party whom they are unnecessarily involving with my past.</p>

        </h2>
        <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal line-4">If we had to list down some of the most striking features of our solar system, the iconic ring systems around certain planets — especially the glorious Saturn — would most definitely make it to the top. But what if we told you those spectacular rings may soon become a thing of the past? They may appear fixed from Earth, but astronomers have long known that Saturn's innermost rings erode into its upper atmosphere due to the planet's intense gravity. So powerful is this gravitational pull, that bits and pieces of these icy rings raining down on the planet can fill up an Olympic-sized swimming pool every day! To better understand just how fast the rings are disappearing, scientists have roped in NASA's incredible James Webb Space Telescope and Hawaii's Keck Observatory to carry out long-term observations of the 'ring rain' phenomenon. These observations will be made during an entire season on Saturn, which is equivalent to about seven years on Earth.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">A massive asteroid, dubbed Asteroid 2006 HV5, is hurtling towards Earth at breakneck speed and will make its closest approach on April 26, NASA has warned. While it is not expected to cause a catastrophic event, the 1000-foot asteroid is almost the size of the Empire State Building and can cause regional damage if it were to hit a crowded city. The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is home to most of the asteroids in the solar system, and MIT scientists have developed a new method to study their internal structure based on their spin. This technique could help future missions, including the DART mission, which aims to deflect dangerous asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth.</p>

Although promising results on the wafer-scale synthesis of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) have already been reported, the high-quality synthesis of 2D materials on wafers of 200 mm or larger, which are typically used in commercial silicon foundries, remains difficult. To prevent the chip from getting damaged, scientists also developed a low-temperature growth process that allows 2D semiconductor transistors to be directly integrated on top of standard silicon circuits.</p>

        </h2>
        <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal line-4">Uric acid, a crucial waste product, forms part of the most important anti-oxidants found in the biological fluids of humans. According to doctors, in normal circumstances, the uric acid levels should range between 3.5 to 7.2 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL). Uric acid is created when the human body breaks down purines which is a type of chemical. Health experts maintain that most uric acid dissolves in the blood, passes through the kidneys and leaves the body in urine. However, certain food and drinks like Seafood, red meat, organ meats like liver, alcohol (especially beer, including non-alcohol beer) etc., can lead to increased levels of uric acid in the body.</p>
