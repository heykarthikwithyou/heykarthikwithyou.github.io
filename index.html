        <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal line-4">If anything, climate change has certainly made conversations about the weather much more interesting. The topic has quickly shifted from effortless small talk to genuine concerns about coping with the growing summer heat every passing year. While most of these discussions may remain casual and based on 'feel', extensive scientific evidence actually supports their legitimacy as well. In addition to being a behemoth of a greenhouse gas emitter, many studies have shown that India is also one of the most vulnerable countries to projected climate change. And make no mistake, the change is already underway.</p>

                  <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Germany switched off its last three nuclear reactors on Saturday, exiting atomic power even as it seeks to wean itself off fossil fuels and manage an energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. While many Western countries are upping their investments in atomic energy to reduce their emissions, Germany brought an early end to its nuclear age.</p>

                  <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">The leaked files have revealed that up to 50 Special Forces, most likely the SAS, have been sent to Ukraine. According to the records, it’s possible that more than half of the Special Forces soldiers from Western countries who were in Ukraine between February and March of this year were British. The revelation comes after more than a year of speculation that Western countries have also sent their troops to Ukraine, despite their “no boots on the ground” strategy in the ongoing conflict. The document, however, failed to specify what role these Special Forces have been asked to play in Ukraine.</p>

        <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal line-4">As the Ukraine-Russia war continues, much has been said about India's ongoing import of Russian oil. Putting its own interests front and centre, New Delhi has been buying oil from Moscow at a steep discount since global powers imposed sanctions against the Kremlin. Now, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has indicated that the country will explore buying Russian crude oil near or past the price cap imposed by the G-7 if necessary.</p>

In Thursday’s case, the hybrid eclipse will start with the moon completely blocking out the sun, a total eclipse, to it partially blocking out part of the sun, leaving just a “ring of fire” visible in the sky, an annular eclipse</p>

It causes asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection in birds. In addition, a high cross-species transmission ability makes the virus a potential source for the origination of other animal influenza viruses. The first human case of AIV infection (H3N8) was detected in China in April 2022. The patient was present with recurrent fever and severe pneumonia. The second case with mild influenza symptoms was detected in May 2022. These cases raised global concern about the possibility of a significant public health threat by H3N8 AIVs.</p>

A diet high in sugar, fat and calories can cause fatty liver in kids. There may not be any symptoms of this condition in kids, however if the damage is greater children may report stomach pain, fatigue or jaundice. To treat fatty liver in kids, parents must work on making appropriate lifestyle modifications. Fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and other high-fibre foods must be added to the diet and daily exercise and playtime must be encouraged.</p>
