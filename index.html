The director has taken a big step in his career by signing a deal with CAA, a Hollywood talent agency that represents several prominent personalities in the film industry. Sanjay Leela Bhansali, another celebrated filmmaker in Bollywood, has also recently signed up with a Hollywood agency, WME, which represents big names like Ben Affleck, Jessica Alba, Christian Bale, Kate Beckinsale, and Matt Damon. This move has sparked speculation about Bhansali's interest in exploring opportunities in the West.</h5>

                <h5 class="font-weight-normal m-0">Urine consists mainly of water and should generally be odorless, according to health experts. However, sometimes urine takes on a certain odor which can be because of varying reasons. An odor in urine is usually not a bad thing. However, it can be a cause of concern, especially if it's accompanied by other symptoms, such as blood in the urine or a burning sensation while peeing. Frequent trips to the bathroom could also indicate that there is a problem. If your urine is accompanied by a strong smell of ammonia, it can be a sign of a UTI.</h5>

Internet shutdowns are broadly understood as the disruption of broadband or mobile-based internet access in a given geographic area as a result of a government directive. While these shutdowns are put in place to address some ‘harm’ that is facilitated by the internet, there is no rulebook in place for instances in which they can be ordered. Moreover, these measures fail to discriminate between innocuous and allegedly harmful uses of the internet. To top it all off, such shutdowns are ordered not by the legislature, but by the executive.</p>

        <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal line-4">Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become very popular across the globe. Since its early days, when the machines were learning basic commands, the AI has evolved into a conversational chatbot. It can not only understand long sentences, AI-driven programmes like ChatGPT can also process and give long answers. In recent months, the chatbot has even solved complex mathematical problems and answered spiritual questions. Its rapid evolution has scared many people, including experts. But is there something that AI is afraid of? One Reddit user asked the question to ChatGPT and the bot's answer is now viral.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">You are what you eat. The age-old aphorism has received a 21st-century genetic nod of approval, with an added caveat: when. A new study shows time-restricted eating (TRE), where food consumption is limited to a window of eight to 10 hours, regulates the nervous system and improves cognitive function and metabolic activity. Even though the study was conducted on mice, it expands the scope of nutrition epigenetics that looks at the connection between food and gene expressions, and how certain foods can activate specific genes. Conducted by researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Research, US, the study, published in Cell Metabolism in January this year, found that TRE activated genes in over 22 regions of the body and brain. Almost 40 percent of the genes in the adrenal gland, hypothalamus and pancreas showed a shift, reiterating the positive effect of nutritional interventions in improving brain, heart, lungs, liver and gut health.</p>

The human module will land in the sea. He was speaking to reporters here after the successful launch of two Singaporean satellites, TeLEOS-2 and Lumilite-4, with the rocket Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). Somanath said prior to that, there would be a test of the Gagayaan Mission in June this year, where the rocket will go up to 12-14 km and test its safety systems.</p>

The second case with mild influenza symptoms was detected in May 2022. These cases raised global concern about the possibility of a significant public health threat by H3N8 AIVs.</p>

        <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal line-4">Urine consists mainly of water and should generally be odorless, according to health experts. However, sometimes urine takes on a certain odor which can be because of varying reasons. An odor in urine is usually not a bad thing. However, it can be a cause of concern, especially if it's accompanied by other symptoms, such as blood in the urine or a burning sensation while peeing. Frequent trips to the bathroom could also indicate that there is a problem. If your urine is accompanied by a strong smell of ammonia, it can be a sign of a UTI.</p>
