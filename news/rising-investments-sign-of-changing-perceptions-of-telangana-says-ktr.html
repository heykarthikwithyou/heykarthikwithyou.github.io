          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Anticipating a spurt in the number of dengue cases after a week or so, the Health Department has intensified control measures in Coimbatore district. The counter measures are primarily aimed at preventing the breeding of aedes aegypti mosquito, the primary vector of the virus causing dengue. P. Aruna, Deputy Director of Health Services, Coimbatore district, said the spurt was anticipated as the district received good spells of summer showers. “Chances of an increase in the breeding of mosquitoes are high as the rains have stopped. Health inspectors have been instructed to contact administrations of temples, mosques and churches to circulate village-specific awareness messages. Health inspectors have been asked to tie-up with scrap dealers who will collect waste materials, which may turn breeding ground for mosquitoes. The scrap dealers will visit a specific day in a village to collect such materials,” she said</p>

The search was conducted as part of NIA’s raids at over 100 places in six states. Police said a NIA team started the search at about 6am at a house linked to Gurvinder Singh, who lives in Canada and is currently in the country to visit his family. Police officers said there have been instances of people living in Udham Singh Nagar sympathising with separatist groups of Khalistanis in the past.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory – India (LIGO-India) on Thursday, when the country celebrates the 25th anniversary of the Pokhran-II nuclear tests. PM Modi will also dedicate to the nation a Rare Earth Permanent Magnet Plant at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre campus at Visakhapatnam and a Fission Moly-99 Production Facility in Mumbai, to produce the radioisotope used in more than 85 per cent of imaging procedures for early detection of cancer and heart disease. May 11 marks the 25th anniversary of the 1998 nuclear tests carried out at Pokhran test range, including its first test of a thermonuclear device, which has since been celebrated as the National Technology Day to honour scientists, engineers and technologists who made the tests possible.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Cannes 2023 opened with the premiere of Johnny Depp's film Jeanne du Barry, directed by Maiwenn, in which the actor plays French King Louis XV. It is being touted as Mr Depp's 'comeback' film after last year's high-profile defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard. According to Variety, the actor, who hasn't been seen in public much after his victory in the trial, received an enthusiastic seven-minute standing ovation on Tuesday night after the film's careening. Several clips showing Mr Depp getting emotional have gone viral on social media.</p>

Another news to be noted here is that the film will have one single title in all the five Indian languages, which is a standard practise for pan Indian films from Tollywood. The film is set for release on the 5th of April, 2024. The shooting is progressing at a brisk pace now.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Manoj Bajpayee-starrer Sirf Ek Bandaa Kaafi Hai dropped on Monday and it has created quite a buzz. Said to be ‘inspired’ by true events, it features the star as a passionate lawyer, fighting against a godman who is accused of raping a minor. Self-styled godman Asaram Bapu, who is currently serving a life sentence, after being convicted of a similar crime, has now slapped the makers with a legal notice. Asaram, through his charitable trust, has sent a legal notice on the makers and has asked the courts to issue “prohibitory orders against the promotion and release of the film.” They have termed the film “highly objectionable” and “defamatory” towards their client and has the potential to “tarnish his reputation and hit sentiments of his devotees.”</p>

The 2023 Sudirman Cup is slated to be held from 14th to 21st May in Suzhou, China. As per a report in Times of India, the Indian contingent, which is currently training in Hyderabad, has a flight booked for 10th May to travel to China from Bengaluru. The Badminton Association of India (BAI) has reportedly escalated this matter to the Badminton World Federation (BWF) under whose aegis the Sudirman Cup is hosted. What is to be noted here is the fact that the Chinese contingent had faced a similar issue while travelling to India for the 2023 India Open earlier in the year. But, this issue was duly solved following the intervention of BAI</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">SpaceX founder and science-fiction fan Elon Musk is attempting to make the fiction of space travel a scientific reality. ‘In order to safeguard the existence of humanity,’ he explains, ‘we need to become a multi-planetary civilization.’ Musk says he’s laser-focused on ensuring we make a second home elsewhere in space, and has his sights set on Mars. He’s not alone, of course. NASA’s recently-released Moon to Mars Architecture Concept Review is a ‘study of the hardware and operations needed for human missions to the Moon and Mars,’ leading to long-term scientific discovery and human habitation in deep space.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Details have been released by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory about five asteroids that will approach Earth closely in May. Asteroid 2023 HG1 is currently travelling towards Earth at a speed of 7200 KMPH (2 KMPH) and is estimated to be the size of a house. On May 9, 2023, it is expected to pass within 2,590,000 miles (4,160,000 km) of Earth, with a diameter of 60 feet (18 metres).</p>

Chandrayaan, India’s lunar exploration programme, is an ongoing series of outer space missions by Isro. The first moon rocket, Chandrayaan-1, was launched in 2008 and was successfully inserted into lunar orbit.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">If we had to list down some of the most striking features of our solar system, the iconic ring systems around certain planets — especially the glorious Saturn — would most definitely make it to the top. But what if we told you those spectacular rings may soon become a thing of the past? They may appear fixed from Earth, but astronomers have long known that Saturn's innermost rings erode into its upper atmosphere due to the planet's intense gravity. So powerful is this gravitational pull, that bits and pieces of these icy rings raining down on the planet can fill up an Olympic-sized swimming pool every day! To better understand just how fast the rings are disappearing, scientists have roped in NASA's incredible James Webb Space Telescope and Hawaii's Keck Observatory to carry out long-term observations of the 'ring rain' phenomenon. These observations will be made during an entire season on Saturn, which is equivalent to about seven years on Earth.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">The World Health Organization on May 15 released a new guideline that recommends against the use of non-sugar sweeteners to control body weight or reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases. The Geneva-based WHO based the recommendation on a systemic review of available evidence, which suggests the use of non-sugar sweeteners does not confer any long-term benefit in reducing body fat in adults or children. The review also suggested the long-term use of non-sugar sweeteners potentially may have undesirable effects such as an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and mortality in adults.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Anticipating a spurt in the number of dengue cases after a week or so, the Health Department has intensified control measures in Coimbatore district. The counter measures are primarily aimed at preventing the breeding of aedes aegypti mosquito, the primary vector of the virus causing dengue. P. Aruna, Deputy Director of Health Services, Coimbatore district, said the spurt was anticipated as the district received good spells of summer showers. “Chances of an increase in the breeding of mosquitoes are high as the rains have stopped. Health inspectors have been instructed to contact administrations of temples, mosques and churches to circulate village-specific awareness messages. Health inspectors have been asked to tie-up with scrap dealers who will collect waste materials, which may turn breeding ground for mosquitoes. The scrap dealers will visit a specific day in a village to collect such materials,” she said</p>
