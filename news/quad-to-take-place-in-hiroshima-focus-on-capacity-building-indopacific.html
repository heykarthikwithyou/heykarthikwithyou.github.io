        Despite change on travel plans of US President Joseph Biden, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend the G-7 and Quad summit in Hiroshima and then proceed to attend the Indo-Pacific Forum meeting in Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea and round up his travel with a bilateral summit in Australia. According to officials, Quad is not a gang up of democratic powers against China but all about mutual economic, technological and security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. That the belligerence of the Xi Jinping regime in the Indo-Pacific is one of the foundation pillars of Quad, there is no doubt. While US President Biden is also expected to meet PM Modi on the side-lines of the G-7 summit, the two countries along with Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates will announce an MoU very soon on regional integration of the Middle East with road and rail infrastructure as an alternative to China’s Belt Road Initiative (BRI). Decision to this effect was taken in a meeting between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Deputy Ruler of UAE Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on May 7.

That is the Parliament of India, for it is here that, through their representatives, the citizens of India exercise their sovereignty. And with a new Parliament building on the cusp of being inaugurated, Indian citizens are about to move to a new home. Indeed, it is in Parliament, over the last seven decades, that India’s citizens have expressed their political preferences. They have kept the executive in check and made it accountable through relentless questions and votes. They have framed laws. They have debated fiercely.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">In an act of bravery, a man fearlessly jumped into freezing waters to save a dog from drowning. A video shows how he ignored the icy temperatures and plugged into the water without hesitation when he saw the pooch struggling. His act of kindness was also captured on camera and later shared on Instagram. The rescue video has left people with a warm feeling in their hearts. Holly Morphew originally captured the video and shared it back in February. “Yesterday my friend and I went for a walk around Sloan’s Lake. We saw a dog take off from the opposite side of the lake full speed ahead chasing geese. We watched in horror knowing the ice would soon run out. It did, and the dog went down into the lake. It struggled for a long time as we helplessly looked on, praying it could break enough ice to get to the shore. But it was getting tired and we could see the struggle wasn’t going to last much longer. We called 911 and the fire department was on its way. We weren’t sure their rescue would be fast enough. Then, a #hero took off his clothes and went in to save it. I am so happy to say he did, and both he and the dog were ok. This man saved a dog’s life yesterday and for that I am so thankful. Thank you to those who act #selflessly. He definitely did risk his life to save another,” she wrote.</p>

In a letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, cited by CNBC US, Yellen wrote, “We now estimate that the Treasury will have insufficient resources to satisfy the government’s obligations if Congress has not raised or suspended the debt limit by June 5.” Yellen’s letter comes at a time when tensions have built over whether a deal between the White House and Republicans in Congress will be struck in time as the so-called “X-date” draws close. Last time, the date was updated on May 1. Yellen had then said the US had enough cash available to meet its obligations until “early June, and potentially as early as June 1.”</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Tina Turner, the unstoppable singer and stage performer who teamed with husband Ike Turner for a dynamic run of hit records and live shows in the 1960s and ’70s and survived her horrifying marriage to triumph in middle age with the chart-topping “What’s Love Got to Do With It,” has died at 83. Turner died Tuesday, after a long illness in her home in Küsnacht near Zurich, according to her manager. She became a Swiss citizen a decade ago. Few stars traveled so far — she was born Anna Mae Bullock in a segregated Tennessee hospital and spent her latter years on a 260,000 square foot estate on Lake Zurich — and overcame so much. Physically battered, emotionally devastated and financially ruined by her 20-year relationship with Ike Turner, she became a superstar on her own in her 40s, at a time when most of her peers were on their way down, and remained a top concert draw for years after.</p>

As per a report in Times of India, the Indian contingent, which is currently training in Hyderabad, has a flight booked for 10th May to travel to China from Bengaluru. The Badminton Association of India (BAI) has reportedly escalated this matter to the Badminton World Federation (BWF) under whose aegis the Sudirman Cup is hosted. What is to be noted here is the fact that the Chinese contingent had faced a similar issue while travelling to India for the 2023 India Open earlier in the year.

A new study published in the journal Nature has recently discovered that modern humans evolved from atleast two places in Africa.

He’s not alone, of course. NASA’s recently-released Moon to Mars Architecture Concept Review is a ‘study of the hardware and operations needed for human missions to the Moon and Mars,’ leading to long-term scientific discovery and human habitation in deep space.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">The World Health Organization on May 15 released a new guideline that recommends against the use of non-sugar sweeteners to control body weight or reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases. The Geneva-based WHO based the recommendation on a systemic review of available evidence, which suggests the use of non-sugar sweeteners does not confer any long-term benefit in reducing body fat in adults or children. The review also suggested the long-term use of non-sugar sweeteners potentially may have undesirable effects such as an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and mortality in adults.</p>

The counter measures are primarily aimed at preventing the breeding of aedes aegypti mosquito, the primary vector of the virus causing dengue. P. Aruna, Deputy Director of Health Services, Coimbatore district, said the spurt was anticipated as the district received good spells of summer showers. “Chances of an increase in the breeding of mosquitoes are high as the rains have stopped. Health inspectors have been instructed to contact administrations of temples, mosques and churches to circulate village-specific awareness messages. Health inspectors have been asked to tie-up with scrap dealers who will collect waste materials, which may turn breeding ground for mosquitoes. The scrap dealers will visit a specific day in a village to collect such materials,” she said</p>

Inaugurating the 'Janganana Bhawan', the office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India, Mr Shah said census is a process that may form the basis of development agenda. Digital, complete and accurate census figures will have multi-dimensional benefits, he said, adding planning based on the census data ensures development reaches the poorest of the poor.</p>
