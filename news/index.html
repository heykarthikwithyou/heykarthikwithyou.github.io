                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Telugu actor Naga Chaitanya opened up about his divorce from Samantha Ruth Prabhu and the impact of his dating rumours on his equation with ex-wife Samantha Ruth Prabhu. The Custody actor was married to the Kushi star for almost four years before they announced their separation in 2021. While Chaitanya and Samantha have been tight-lipped about the reason behind their split, the actor confirmed that the divorce came through last year and they’ve been legally single for a year now. Speaking with the Times of India, Naga Chaitanya said that he and Samantha have moved on in their lives. Praising Samantha, Chaitanya said, “She is a lovely person and deserves all happiness. It is only when the media speculates that things get awkward between us. In the public eye, that mutual respect is taken away. That’s what I feel bad about. And you do what is worse? They bring in a third party, someone who is not connected to my part to create headlines out of that. It’s very disrespectful to the third party whom they are unnecessarily involving with my past.</p>

                </h5>
                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Uric acid, a crucial waste product, forms part of the most important anti-oxidants found in the biological fluids of humans. According to doctors, in normal circumstances, the uric acid levels should range between 3.5 to 7.2 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL). Uric acid is created when the human body breaks down purines which is a type of chemical. Health experts maintain that most uric acid dissolves in the blood, passes through the kidneys and leaves the body in urine. However, certain food and drinks like Seafood, red meat, organ meats like liver, alcohol (especially beer, including non-alcohol beer) etc., can lead to increased levels of uric acid in the body.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">If we had to list down some of the most striking features of our solar system, the iconic ring systems around certain planets — especially the glorious Saturn — would most definitely make it to the top. But what if we told you those spectacular rings may soon become a thing of the past? They may appear fixed from Earth, but astronomers have long known that Saturn's innermost rings erode into its upper atmosphere due to the planet's intense gravity. So powerful is this gravitational pull, that bits and pieces of these icy rings raining down on the planet can fill up an Olympic-sized swimming pool every day! To better understand just how fast the rings are disappearing, scientists have roped in NASA's incredible James Webb Space Telescope and Hawaii's Keck Observatory to carry out long-term observations of the 'ring rain' phenomenon. These observations will be made during an entire season on Saturn, which is equivalent to about seven years on Earth.</p>

The CBI registered a case against Mr Goyal, his wife Anita, former director Gaurang Ananda Shetty, and unknown bank officials following a complaint from Canara Bank. The complaint accused the individuals of diverting funds and causing losses to the bank. Sources indicate that the raids at seven locations were not connected to the new owners of Jet Airways, the Jalan Kalrock Consortium, which maintains an office in Gurgaon and is working to revive the airline that was grounded in April 2019 due to financial difficulties.</p>

The two-hour meeting began at 11:45 am ET (1545 GMT) and included Google's Sundar Pichai, Microsoft Corp's Satya Nadella, OpenAI's Sam Altman and Anthropic's Dario Amodei, along with Vice President Kamala Harris and administration officials including Biden's Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Director of the National Economic Council Lael Brainard and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. The growing popularity of generative AI, exemplified by ChatGPT and similar apps, has spurred companies to launch their own versions that they believe will revolutionize various industries. However, with millions of users already utilizing these tools for tasks such as medical diagnoses, writing screenplays, and debugging software, concerns have arisen over privacy violations, biased employment decisions, and the potential for scams and misinformation campaigns. President Biden, who has used ChatGPT himself, urged the officials to prioritize mitigating the current and potential risks AI poses to individuals, society, and national security. The White House highlighted the importance of AI companies ensuring the safety of their products before deployment.</p>

While it is not expected to cause a catastrophic event, the 1000-foot asteroid is almost the size of the Empire State Building and can cause regional damage if it were to hit a crowded city. The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is home to most of the asteroids in the solar system, and MIT scientists have developed a new method to study their internal structure based on their spin. This technique could help future missions, including the DART mission, which aims to deflect dangerous asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Two-dimensional (2D) materials are promising candidates for future electronics. Although promising results on the wafer-scale synthesis of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) have already been reported, the high-quality synthesis of 2D materials on wafers of 200 mm or larger, which are typically used in commercial silicon foundries, remains difficult. To prevent the chip from getting damaged, scientists also developed a low-temperature growth process that allows 2D semiconductor transistors to be directly integrated on top of standard silicon circuits.</p>

The poster shows the title written over a circular maze that swirls into a vortex; ‘Efforts Never Fail’ is written as the tagline of the film. Ajith’s sentiment in naming many of his films with V is well-known, and VidaaMuyarchi, meaning determination in Tamil, is the latest one adhering to that. Other details regarding the plot and cast of the film remain unknown at the moment.</p>

The object of the cooling-off period is not to stretch the already disintegrated marriage, or to prolong the agony and misery of the parties when there are no chances of the marriage working out. Therefore, once every effort has been made to salvage the marriage and there remains no possibility of reunion and cohabitation, the court is not powerless in enabling the parties to avail a better option, which is to grant the divorce. The waiver is not to be given on mere asking, but on the court being satisfied beyond doubt that the marriage has shattered beyond repair.</p>

However, a new study conducted by American scientist's claims that stress can also lead to early ageing. Aside from the psychological and physiological impacts stress has on our body like for example, anxiety, inability to sleep, dark circles, anxiety, etc. stress can also accelerate biological ageing. So, not only is biological age determined by more than just the passage of time, but taking positive action could help prevent the body aging too quickly.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">During the ASU+GSV event in San Diego, Gates estimated that AI chatbots like ChatGPT will be able to help children learn to read and write in the next 18 months. This would be a more economical solution for many disadvantaged parents who cannot afford a human teacher. Gates believes that AI-powered chatbots will become as good as any human tutor and will engage in a dialogue to help students understand their shortcomings.</p>

Or, if you find it more appropriate, because one of its key members, the host, is at odds with the other two. Don’t fall for the temptation to say the more things change, the more they stay the same. There are indeed things that remain the same, like India’s slow strategic asphyxiation in the China-Pakistan pincer. Dr Manmohan Singh had described this as a straightforward case of China using Pakistan as a cheap instrument to ‘triangulate’ India. Beyond that, since he handed over the keys to Narendra Modi, much has changed.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">As climate change causes ocean temperatures to rise, one of Greenland’s previously most stable glaciers is now retreating at an unprecedented rate, according to a new study. Led by researchers at The Ohio State University, a team found that between 2018 and 2021, Steenstrup Glacier in Greenland has retreated about 5 miles, thinned about 20%, doubled in the amount of ice it discharges into the ocean, and quadrupled in velocity. According to the study, such a rapid change is so extraordinary among Greenland ice formations that it now places Steenstrup in the top 10% of glaciers that contribute to the entire region’s total ice discharge.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Jeff Bezos beat large retailers by adopting the internet in the early 1990s through a combination of innovative thinking, strategic planning, and execution. At the time, most retailers were operating through brick-and-mortar stores, with very little online presence. However, Bezos saw the potential of the internet as a new sales channel, and he realised that by leveraging its reach, he could offer a much wider selection of products to customers than traditional retailers could.</p>

However, sometimes urine takes on a certain odor which can be because of varying reasons. An odor in urine is usually not a bad thing. However, it can be a cause of concern, especially if it's accompanied by other symptoms, such as blood in the urine or a burning sensation while peeing. Frequent trips to the bathroom could also indicate that there is a problem. If your urine is accompanied by a strong smell of ammonia, it can be a sign of a UTI.</p>

When normal liver cells undergo genetic alterations that cause them to become abnormal, the aberrant cells proliferate uncontrollably to become liver cancer tumour masses. Each year, this disease is discovered in more than 8,000 persons worldwide. With more than 7,00,000 fatalities from cancer each year, it is also one of the main cause of cancer mortality globally. Long-term liver illness (also known as chronic liver disease) is seen in more than half of patients who develop liver cancer.</p>

A new study shows time-restricted eating (TRE), where food consumption is limited to a window of eight to 10 hours, regulates the nervous system and improves cognitive function and metabolic activity. Even though the study was conducted on mice, it expands the scope of nutrition epigenetics that looks at the connection between food and gene expressions, and how certain foods can activate specific genes. Conducted by researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Research, US, the study, published in Cell Metabolism in January this year, found that TRE activated genes in over 22 regions of the body and brain. Almost 40 percent of the genes in the adrenal gland, hypothalamus and pancreas showed a shift, reiterating the positive effect of nutritional interventions in improving brain, heart, lungs, liver and gut health.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">On Saturday, the Chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) 'S. Somanath' revealed that the space agency is planning to send up the first uncrewed Launch Vehicle Mark-3 rocket in February 2024 as part of the Gaganyaan Mission. The human module will land in the sea. He was speaking to reporters here after the successful launch of two Singaporean satellites, TeLEOS-2 and Lumilite-4, with the rocket Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). Somanath said prior to that, there would be a test of the Gagayaan Mission in June this year, where the rocket will go up to 12-14 km and test its safety systems.</p>

The Laureates had shown that entangled particles (physically apart yet linked) can ferry information over massive distances. This has far-reaching implications for quantum communications tech (QCT), of key strategic significance to India and one of the four verticals for the mission’s R&D. QCT allows a country to secure its critical infrastructure with quantum cryptography to make it.</p>

Internet shutdowns are broadly understood as the disruption of broadband or mobile-based internet access in a given geographic area as a result of a government directive. While these shutdowns are put in place to address some ‘harm’ that is facilitated by the internet, there is no rulebook in place for instances in which they can be ordered. Moreover, these measures fail to discriminate between innocuous and allegedly harmful uses of the internet. To top it all off, such shutdowns are ordered not by the legislature, but by the executive.</p>

Let’s face it, everyone loves the sweet kick. There is nothing like an ice-cream treat after dinner, especially in the sweltering summer as you drive the kids to the dessert junction. There is no greater joy than receiving a box of kaju katli and binge-eating with the children glued to Netflix. There is an unbeatable sense of satisfaction in having just-one-bite of sweets after every meal, isn’t it?</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Sleep is a precious commodity for people and across the animal kingdom, indispensable even as its biological purpose remains somewhat mysterious. We spend about a third of our lives asleep. But some animals get a lot less slumber – with certain species like the northern elephant seal taking sleeplessness to an extreme. Researchers in a new study described the unusual sleep habits of this species, finding that during Pacific Ocean foraging journeys that can last seven months these bulky marine mammals sleep just two hours a day – cobbled together from naps of about 10 minutes each as they dive deep to avoid predators. The only other mammal known to get so little sleep is the African elephant.</p>

However, Mumtaz’s journey so far has been anything but easy as she has faced many hurdles in her career. Mumtaz’s list of challenges includes two ACL injuries in 2019 and 2022.</p>

The remote tourist town with fewer than 3,000 residents was promoted as one of the best vantage points in Australia to see the eclipse that also crosses remote parts of Indonesia and East Timor.</p>

                </h5>
                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">If anything, climate change has certainly made conversations about the weather much more interesting. The topic has quickly shifted from effortless small talk to genuine concerns about coping with the growing summer heat every passing year. While most of these discussions may remain casual and based on 'feel', extensive scientific evidence actually supports their legitimacy as well. In addition to being a behemoth of a greenhouse gas emitter, many studies have shown that India is also one of the most vulnerable countries to projected climate change. And make no mistake, the change is already underway.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">A high prevalence of the H3 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) has been observed among waterfowl globally. It causes asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection in birds. In addition, a high cross-species transmission ability makes the virus a potential source for the origination of other animal influenza viruses. The first human case of AIV infection (H3N8) was detected in China in April 2022. The patient was present with recurrent fever and severe pneumonia. The second case with mild influenza symptoms was detected in May 2022. These cases raised global concern about the possibility of a significant public health threat by H3N8 AIVs.</p>

Australia as well as some locations in Southeast Asia will be able to see this rare occurrence on April 20. A hybrid solar eclipse is a combination of two other solar eclipses. In Thursday’s case, the hybrid eclipse will start with the moon completely blocking out the sun, a total eclipse, to it partially blocking out part of the sun, leaving just a “ring of fire” visible in the sky, an annular eclipse</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Unhealthy eating pattern in children coupled with sedentary lifestyle due to excessive screen time is putting them at risk of several lifestyle diseases early on in life. A diet high in sugar, fat and calories can cause fatty liver in kids. There may not be any symptoms of this condition in kids, however if the damage is greater children may report stomach pain, fatigue or jaundice. To treat fatty liver in kids, parents must work on making appropriate lifestyle modifications. Fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and other high-fibre foods must be added to the diet and daily exercise and playtime must be encouraged.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">While the BJP is yet to kick off its campaign in West Bengal, the party is already in action mode with Union Home Minister Amit Shah setting the tone ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha election in the state. Mr Shah has set a target for the BJP - 35 of the state's 42 parliamentary seats. In 2019, the BJP won 18 seats. At a rally in Suri in Birbhum district, Mr Shah targeted Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Trinamool Congress's National General Secretary Abhishek Banerjee and Anubrata Mondal - the powerful TMC district president for Birbhum who has delivered for the party all these years.</p>

According to the records, it’s possible that more than half of the Special Forces soldiers from Western countries who were in Ukraine between February and March of this year were British. The revelation comes after more than a year of speculation that Western countries have also sent their troops to Ukraine, despite their “no boots on the ground” strategy in the ongoing conflict. The document, however, failed to specify what role these Special Forces have been asked to play in Ukraine.</p>

If it were in our solar system, it would cover the distance between the Earth and the Moon in 14 minutes. The black hole weighs as much as 20 million Suns and is also leaving behind a 200,000-light-year-long trail of newborn stars in its wake. To put that into context, the diameter of the Milky Way is about 100,000 light years.</p>

Lalit Yadav and David Warner have kept things moving and added over 50 runs for the fourth wicket.

The pair added 98 runs for the opening wicket before Mukesh Kumar removed the former for 60(31) in the 9th over.

                </h5>
                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Tech giant Google is planning to add artificial intelligence (AI) features to its search engine. This comes as it battles intense competition from Open AI's chatbot ChatGPT. In an interview to Wall Street Journal, Google chief executive officer (CEO) Sundar Pichai said that the new AI features will enhance the search engine's ability to answer queries. He rejected the notion that chatbots are a threat to Google's search business. The search business accounts for more than half of revenue at its parent Alphabet. The search ads are the biggest moneymaker for the company, bringing in $162 billion revenue last year.</p>

This also assumes significance given that many global agencies have lowered India’s growth forecast for 2023-24 amid expectations of global economic slowdown and monetary tightening by other countries across the Atlantic</p>

The clashes at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem have raised tensions between Israelis and Palestinians, leading to rocket fire from both sides. The violence began on Monday when Israeli police stormed the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, which is considered one of the holiest sites in Islam, during Ramadan prayers. The move sparked outrage among Palestinians, who responded by throwing rocks and other objects at Israeli police. The police responded with stun grenades and tear gas, leading to violent clashes that left over 300 Palestinians and over 20 police officers injured.</p>

The world health body demanded that Beijing must immediately share all relevant information. From a theory that the virus jumped naturally to humans from animals and another saying that the virus likely leaked from a Wuhan laboratory, scientists have remained divided about the origins of the virus. A study claimed last month that raccoon dogs, known to be able to carry and transmit viruses that causes Covid, were at a market in Wuhan when the disease was first detected.</p>

This jump comes a day after the country reported 5,300 cases yesterday. With an uptick in the trend of Covid cases, scientists said that XBB.1.16 is the Covid-19 variant responsible for the present surge. However, scientists say that people in India have developed hybrid immunity (due to vaccination and natural infection). Therefore, the present Covid-19 variants will not cause a lot of hospitalization. However, the government has suggested people wear masks in crowded places and complete their vaccination doses if not done yet.</p>
