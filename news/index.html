                </h5>
                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Unhealthy eating pattern in children coupled with sedentary lifestyle due to excessive screen time is putting them at risk of several lifestyle diseases early on in life. A diet high in sugar, fat and calories can cause fatty liver in kids. There may not be any symptoms of this condition in kids, however if the damage is greater children may report stomach pain, fatigue or jaundice. To treat fatty liver in kids, parents must work on making appropriate lifestyle modifications. Fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and other high-fibre foods must be added to the diet and daily exercise and playtime must be encouraged.</p>

                </h5>
                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">A retired NASA satellite, Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI), is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere in April, almost 21 years after launch. It does not present any threat to humans, the US space agency said. Launched in 2002, the RHESSI observed solar flares and coronal mass ejections from its low-Earth orbit, helping scientists understand the underlying physics of how such powerful bursts of energy are created.</p>

Mr Shah has set a target for the BJP - 35 of the state's 42 parliamentary seats. In 2019, the BJP won 18 seats. At a rally in Suri in Birbhum district, Mr Shah targeted Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Trinamool Congress's National General Secretary Abhishek Banerjee and Anubrata Mondal - the powerful TMC district president for Birbhum who has delivered for the party all these years.</p>

According to the records, it’s possible that more than half of the Special Forces soldiers from Western countries who were in Ukraine between February and March of this year were British. The revelation comes after more than a year of speculation that Western countries have also sent their troops to Ukraine, despite their “no boots on the ground” strategy in the ongoing conflict. The document, however, failed to specify what role these Special Forces have been asked to play in Ukraine.</p>

If it were in our solar system, it would cover the distance between the Earth and the Moon in 14 minutes. The black hole weighs as much as 20 million Suns and is also leaving behind a 200,000-light-year-long trail of newborn stars in its wake. To put that into context, the diameter of the Milky Way is about 100,000 light years.</p>

Lalit Yadav and David Warner have kept things moving and added over 50 runs for the fourth wicket.

The pair added 98 runs for the opening wicket before Mukesh Kumar removed the former for 60(31) in the 9th over.

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Hosts New Zealand clinched the three-match T20I series against Sri Lanka 2-1 after a thrilling decider in Queenstown on Saturday (April 8). After Sri Lanka posted a strong 182/6 from their 20 overs, riding on the back of a 48-ball 73 from Kusal Mendis, Tom Seifert led the reply with an equally brutal 88 off just 48 but a last over collapse took the chase down to the penultimate ball of the game.</p>

                </h5>
                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Tech giant Google is planning to add artificial intelligence (AI) features to its search engine. This comes as it battles intense competition from Open AI's chatbot ChatGPT. In an interview to Wall Street Journal, Google chief executive officer (CEO) Sundar Pichai said that the new AI features will enhance the search engine's ability to answer queries. He rejected the notion that chatbots are a threat to Google's search business. The search business accounts for more than half of revenue at its parent Alphabet. The search ads are the biggest moneymaker for the company, bringing in $162 billion revenue last year.</p>

This also assumes significance given that many global agencies have lowered India’s growth forecast for 2023-24 amid expectations of global economic slowdown and monetary tightening by other countries across the Atlantic</p>

The clashes at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem have raised tensions between Israelis and Palestinians, leading to rocket fire from both sides. The violence began on Monday when Israeli police stormed the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, which is considered one of the holiest sites in Islam, during Ramadan prayers. The move sparked outrage among Palestinians, who responded by throwing rocks and other objects at Israeli police. The police responded with stun grenades and tear gas, leading to violent clashes that left over 300 Palestinians and over 20 police officers injured.</p>

The world health body demanded that Beijing must immediately share all relevant information. From a theory that the virus jumped naturally to humans from animals and another saying that the virus likely leaked from a Wuhan laboratory, scientists have remained divided about the origins of the virus. A study claimed last month that raccoon dogs, known to be able to carry and transmit viruses that causes Covid, were at a market in Wuhan when the disease was first detected.</p>

This jump comes a day after the country reported 5,300 cases yesterday. With an uptick in the trend of Covid cases, scientists said that XBB.1.16 is the Covid-19 variant responsible for the present surge. However, scientists say that people in India have developed hybrid immunity (due to vaccination and natural infection). Therefore, the present Covid-19 variants will not cause a lot of hospitalization. However, the government has suggested people wear masks in crowded places and complete their vaccination doses if not done yet.</p>
